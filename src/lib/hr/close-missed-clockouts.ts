/**
 * Sweep any Attendance row from a past day that has clockIn but no clockOut.
 * Marks status = "missed_clock_out" so:
 *   • the frontend stops live-ticking the elapsed-time counter on stale rows
 *   • the user sees a clear "regularize this day" signal
 *   • payroll/audit reports can filter these out or require a regularization
 *
 * Idempotent — re-running has zero effect on already-flagged rows (they're
 * excluded by the `status: { notIn: [...] }` guard). Safe to call every hour
 * from the internal scheduler and/or from an external cron.
 *
 * Returns the number of rows that were updated by this call.
