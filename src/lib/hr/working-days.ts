/**
 * Count the working days between `from` and `to` inclusive, excluding
 * non-working days and any HolidayCalendar row in that window.
 *
 * `shift` (optional) decides which days are working. When omitted/null the
 * legacy Mon–Fri rule applies (every existing 2-arg caller keeps today's
 * behaviour). When a shift is passed, its workDays + alternate-Saturday rule
 * (saturdayWeeks) drive the count — see {@link isWorkingDay}.
 *
 * All arithmetic is UTC-based:
 *   • the leave form posts dates as "YYYY-MM-DD" → parsed as UTC midnight,
 *   • Prisma returns @db.Date columns as UTC-midnight Date objects,
 *   • the server may run in UTC or IST — using getUTCDay() / setUTCDate()
 *     gives the same answer either way and prevents off-by-one weekend
 *     bugs when crossing TZ boundaries.
